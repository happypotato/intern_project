    "\n",
    "This notebook is capable of training and testing any PTB model as part of the PlaybookIQ framework.  Today, this includes any product with purchase history captured in DIM_OPPORTUNITY.  This notebook is the heart of PlaybookIQ and is where all the data collection and feature engineering up to this point come together with the model fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook also takes care of the heavy lifting of running PTB models in parallel (i.e. \"in bulk\").  There is a PTB model for every possible cross-sell target so potentially thousands of them (examples are \"Sales Cloud - Unlimited Edition\", \"ISVForce\", \"Service Cloud Prefessional Edition\", etc).  Since PlaybookIQ is a general framework, when we make changes we want to see the impact across all PTB models.  Thereforce, being able to run a large number PTB models quickly (in parallel) is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each PTB model requires 20-30GB of memory, so if you run 20 at once you would need 400-600GB of memory.  Petronas (rserver1) has no problems running even 20 models simultaneously.\n"
